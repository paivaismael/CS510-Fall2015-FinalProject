# CS510/Fall2015 - Final Project

### Ismael Lucas de Paiva

While studying Juliaset fractals during the semester, I observed an interesting pattern on the plots for c=1+1i and real multiples of it.

**Julia-Originals** contains 4 specific cases where we can observe that pattern, all of then plotted with *3000x3000* points in the region $-10\leqslant x\leqslant 10$ and $-10\leqslant y\leqslant 10$:

* `mandelbrot.jpg` : The *mandelbrot plot* correspondent to the region.
* `juliaset1.jpg` : c=1+1i
* `juliaset2.jpg` : c=2+2i
* `juliaset3.jpg` : c=4+4i
* `juliaset4.jpg` : c=8+8i

**Julia-Zoomeds** contains other folders, each of them has the name of a *juliaset plot* mentioned above and contains zoomed plots of it (with the respective *mandelbrot plot*). Unfurtunetely, there is no more interesting information in the new plots.

**Mandelbrot** contains some zoomed plots used to explore some regions of the *mandelbrot plot*.
