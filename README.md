# CS510-Fall2015-FinalProject

This repository is the final project for the CS510 Fall 2015 class and contains programs designed to make Juliaset and Mandelbrot fractal plots. The files are organized as following:

* `C-Juliasets` : Contains two C useful libraries (**complex**, that defines complex numbers as an structure and defines some operations with them, and **cplane**, that defines a complex plane as an appropriated matrix with complex numbers) and the C program **julia.c**, that uses the libraries and outputs the value of *juliaset iteration* for each point of a certain region of the complex plane.
* `Cpp-Mandelbrot` : Contains two useful C++ libraries (**julia**, that implements *juliamap*, and **cplane**, that defines a complex plane as an appropriated matrix with complex numbers) and the C++ program **mandelbrot.cpp**, that uses the libraries and outputs the value of *juliaset iteration* for each point of a certain region of the complex plane in the way studied by Mandelbrot, i.e., considering only the points of the complex plane region is being analyzed (there is no *c* to be considered).
* `Datasets` : Contains plots generated with the files mentioned above and the file **data.md**, that explains why those specific plots were chosen.

In this main folder, it is found the following files:

* `generate_output.sh` : Bash script that runs the mentioned programs **julia.c** and **mandelbrot.cpp**, saving the outputs into csv files (**juliaset.csv** and **mandelbrot.csv**, respectively).
* `plot_data.py` : Python script that receives the data generated by running **generate_output.sh** and plots it.
